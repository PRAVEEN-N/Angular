# Angular Lifecycle Hooks

This Repository is for learning Angular.

## `ngOnInit`

`ngOnInit` is a lifecycle hook in Angular that is called once, after the first `ngOnChanges`. It is typically used to perform component initialization, such as fetching data from a service or setting up initial state.

```typescript
import { Component, OnInit } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>Example works!</p>'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnInit {
  constructor() { }

  ngOnInit(): void {
    // Initialization logic here
    console.log('ngOnInit called');
  }
}
```

`ngOnChanges` is another lifecycle hook that is called before `ngOnInit` and whenever one or more data-bound input properties change. It receives a SimpleChanges object that contains the current and previous values of the changed properties.

```typescript
import { Component, OnChanges, SimpleChanges, Input } from '@angular/core';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-example',
  template: '<p>Example works!</p>'
})
export class ExampleComponent implements OnChanges {
  @Input() data: string;

  ngOnChanges(changes: SimpleChanges): void {
    // Respond to input property changes here
    console.log('ngOnChanges called', changes);
  }
}
```
## ngDoCheck

The `ngDoCheck` lifecycle hook is a method in Angular that allows developers to implement their own change detection logic. This method is called during every change detection run, immediately after the default change detector has completed its checks. It is useful for detecting and acting upon changes that Angular's default change detection mechanism might not catch.

### Usage

To use `ngDoCheck`, you need to implement the `DoCheck` interface in your component class and define the `ngDoCheck` method. This method will be called by Angular whenever it performs change detection for that component.
